# ⚡ BlitzNad Code Arena  

A lightning-fast PvP coding platform built on the Monad testnet (EVM-compatible). Players battle in real-time coding challenges, staking tokens with fair resolution via oracle verifiers and instant on-chain rewards powered by Monad’s high-performance blockchain.  

## 🎯 Overview  
BlitzNad fuses learning, gaming, and earning by motivating developers to sharpen coding skills, explore smart contract development on Monad, and compete for real rewards in a scalable, low-latency, trustless environment. With Monad’s parallel execution and near-instant finality, BlitzNad delivers a seamless competitive coding experience that traditional platforms can’t match.
