NadX is a Smart Prediction Aggregator built on Monad, designed to make prediction markets simple, cost-efficient, and accessible to everyone.

While platforms like Polymarket have proven strong demand and billion-dollar valuations, existing prediction markets remain complex and fragmented:

- Users must vote Yes/No separately, calculate slippage, and manage liquidity across multiple pools.

- Liquidity providers need to split capital, leading to higher costs and inefficiency.

- UX is intimidating for new users who just want to make straightforward predictions.

NadX solves these barriers by aggregating liquidity and simplifying the experience:

- One-Pool Liquidity: Capital efficiency for LPs, less fragmentation.

- Simple UX: Users pick outcomes directly (e.g. “Who will be President?” → choose the candidate, no need to vote No on everyone else).

- Basket Predict: Predict multiple outcomes in a single transaction, with optimized pricing and execution.

- Low Costs with Monad: Sub-cent gas fees and 10,000+ TPS make micro-bets possible and scalable.

With NadX, prediction markets become fast, user-friendly, and inclusive, bridging the gap between advanced DeFi mechanics and mainstream adoption.
